[Neko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(software)) is a cat that chases the mouse cursor across the screen, an app written in the late 1980s and ported for many platforms.

This code is a re-implementation using Golang and **has no relationship to the original software**. Furthermore, this version does not use any part of the source code except sprites and sounds.

The goal is to demonstrate the Go language with a fun and very nostalgic example for me, without necessarily being tied to the behavior of the original version.

In this example, we used the [Ebiten](https://ebiten.org), an incredibly easy-to-use gaming library with a vibrant community.
